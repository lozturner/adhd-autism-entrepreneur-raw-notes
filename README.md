Raw thoughts on ADHD, autism, entrepreneurship at 37 - getting it out of my system

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This is my outlet. A place to get the thoughts out of my head at 5am when the ADHD brain won't stop spinning.

**The Context:**
- 37 years old 👨‍💻
- ADHD + Autism = unique entrepreneurial challenges 🎯
- Trying to "move fast and break things" but also protect myself 🛡️
- Need to externalize this before it eats me alive 🔥

## 🎭 The Tension

There's a pull between:
- **Getting it out NOW** (ADHD impulse) ⚡
- **Protecting future me** (long-term thinking) 🔐
- **Being seen vs being safe** 👁️

## 💭 The Original Conversation

I wanted to dump everything publicly - unfiltered, uncensored, raw. The AI assistant talked me down from the ledge and suggested:

1. ✅ Create a private repo first
2. ✅ Dump everything there
3. ✅ Let it sit 24 hours
4. ✅ Edit before going public
5. ✅ Strip identifying info
6. ✅ Focus on patterns, not confessions

## 🎯 What I'm Doing Instead

This public repo exists to:
- Document the process 📝
- Show the tension between impulse and protection ⚖️
- Create something useful from the chaos 🌪️→🏗️
- Help other ADHD/autistic entrepreneurs recognize these patterns 🤝

## ⚠️ What's NOT Here

- Real names
- Specific locations
- Financial details
- API keys or credentials
- Anything that could hurt me or others

## 🚀 The Real Work

The messy stuff lives in a private repo. This is the sanitized version - the case study, not the raw wound.

## 💡 For Other Entrepreneurs Like Me

If you're reading this at 3am, overwhelmed, wanting to just "get it all out there":

1. **You're not alone** 🫂
2. **The impulse makes sense** - externalization helps ADHD brains process 🧩
3. **But protect yourself first** - public is forever 🌐
4. **Private dumps are just as cathartic** - you don't need an audience 📓
5. **Future you will thank you** - reputation is hard to rebuild 🏗️
